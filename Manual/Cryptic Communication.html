                        <h2>On the Subject of Cryptic Communication</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">BRB, gotta go make sure a bomb doesn't blow up.</p>
                        <p>This module will contain a screen and a series of buttons that the defuser can press.</p>

                        <p>Using an external program available here, you can interact with the bomb directly to help the defuser disarm the module.</p>
						
						<h4>Online mode</h4>
						<p>If both you and the defuser can connect to the internet, ask the defuser for a verification code that can be used to connect both of you to the same webpage. From then, the defuser will read you instructions you cannot see, and you must submit commands dependent on what the module requires of you.
						When you input the correct commands, the program will tell the defuser to press certain buttons, in which you must respond with a particular passcode.</p>
						
						<p>When the module is solved, you may use the program to communicate via text if you like.</p>
						
						<h4>Offline mode</h4>
						<p>If either you or the defuser cannot connect to the internet, do not worry! By selecting three buttons before a connection is made, you can use the module and program separately to solve the module. Enter code 0000 or 0FF into the program to switch into offline mode. Ask the user for a verification seed that will be used to sync the offline databases together.</p>
						
						<p>As the defuser waits for a symbol code from you, follow the pre-determined instructions to decrypt a series of numbers into symbols the defuser can press to solve the module. You may need to ask the defuser for various information about the bomb to proceed.</p>
						
						<p>When the module is solved, predetermined messages can still be used with the module by selecting particular symbols given from the program</p>
